Very simple app that shows the growth of cases and number of tests over the days.

It's very useful example to show some functionalities that are available to iOS developers. Also with this app's size it's possible to use only system frameworks, there is no need to add some external dependencies (only [library for charts](https://github.com/nhatminh12369/BarChart) is used).
